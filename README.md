The [1987 Compute! magazine](https://archive.org/stream/1987-06-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_085_1987_Jun#page/n25/mode/1up) game,
["Laser Chess"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Chess) by Mike Duppong,
was one of the larger programs that I typed in.  

The [Amiga BASIC source version](https://archive.org/stream/1987-06-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_085_1987_Jun#page/n37) was by Tim Midkiff and is the basis for this port to p5js.

It is playable in browser with https://rawgit.com/osresearch/laserchess/master/index.html"
